               <h2>What is a Materia Medica?</h2>
               <p>Materia Medica translates to "materials of medicine". The term is derived from the title of ancient Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides' work, De Materia Medica.  Written between 50 and 70 CE and used for over 1500 years thereafter, this pharmacopoeia of medicinal plants is one of the longest lasting and most widely read historical text. Today Materia Medica remains an integral term used when engaging in the study of medicinal plants and herbs as a body of knowledging outlining the specific ways in which these plants have been used throughout time to treat illness and ailments.    </p>

        <p>Also known as a "maypop" or "old field apricot", passionflower is a beautiful, flowering and fruiting perennial.  Cold hardy to zone 6, this native flowering plant is widely distributed throughout the Southeastern United States.  Passionflower thrives in full sun and needs a trellis or vine to climb to reach it's full glory.</p>
        <h3>U S E S</h3>
        <p>Passionflower is used to treat the nervous system as an antispasmodic.  It treats insomnia, anxiety, transitioning from addictions, headaches, overstimulation, hypersensitivity to pain, menstrual cramps.</p>
        <h3>C O N T R A I N D I C A T I O N S</h3>
        <p>Passionflower is not contraindicated by pregnancy or lactation.  It is also considered safe for children in the appropriate dosage.  Passionflower is contraindicated by the following: bradycardia; hypotension; concurrent use of pharmaceutical sedatives.</p>
        <h3>U S E F U L &nbsp; P A R T S</h3>

      <div class="sciname">Zingiber officinale</div>
      <p>Ginger is one of the most commonly consumed dietary condiments in the world. It is a flowering plant, common in Southeast Asia and in the same family as cardamom, galangal, and turmeric.  </p>
      <h3>U S E S</h3>
      <p>The rhizome (underground "root" portion of the plant) is commonly used a spice. The unique flavor and fragrance along with its medicinal properties can be attributed to the bioactive compound, gingerol. Gingerol has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.  It is used to reduce naseau, aid digestion, drastically reduce blood sugar, and prevent heart disease.  It is also useful in the reduction of pain, particularly menstrual cramps.  It also contains a substance that may prevent cancer and protect against Alzheimer's disease.   </p>
      <h3>C O N T R A I N D I C A T I O N S</h3>
      <p>Pregnant people close to labor and/or with a history of miscarriage should use caution when using ginger as a supplement.</p>
      <h3>U S E F U L &nbsp; P A R T S</h3>
      <p>While the rhizome is the most commonly used portion of the ginger plant, the leaves and flowers are also edbile. </p>
      <h3>E D I B I L I T Y</h3>

         <h2>~ M U L L E I N ~</h2>
         <div class="sciname">Verbascum thapsus</div>
         <p>One of my favorite medicinal plants, is a fuzzy leaved biennial.  In its second year of growth, a dense yellow flower stalk emerges. Mullein is weedy and widely available, often found in compacted soil on the sides of roads.  It's long taproot helps to break up the soil and when it's leaves die, the dead foliage adds nutrients to the soil and improves it in such a way making it much more conducive for other plants to thrive.</p>
         <h3>U S E S</h3>
         <p>The Greek physician, Dioscorides was first known to recommend mullein for lung conditions.  The Native Americans used mullein in spiritual ceremonies and smoked it after tobacco to relieve their lungs.  Today, herbalists tincture the herb, use it in teas, and even add it to smoking blends as counterintuitive as it may seem.  The leaves are used to treat respiratory and pulmonary issues while the flowers, with their mild sedative properties, are often harvested to infuse in oil for ear aches. The plant is also useful for immune support, migraines, joint pain, and gout.</p>
         <h3>C O N T R A I N D I C A T I O N S</h3>
         <p>Pregnant and lactating people should use caution.</p>
         <h3>U S E F U L &nbsp; P A R T S</h3>
         <p>Leaves and flowers</p>
         <h3>E D I B I L I T Y</h3>
         <p>While the fuzzy leaves aren't so appetizing, the plant is safe to consume as a tincture or tea. Be sure to thoroughly strain tea as the tiny hairs found on the leaves of mullein can be a throat irritant if swallowed.</p>

         <p>Herbalists in the past have used comfrey internally as a tea or decoction to treat diarhea, ulcers, and internal wounds; however, in the last 20 years countries (including the US) have begun banning the sale of internal prepartions of comfrey due to properties that can cause severe liver damage.  Although many modern herbalists consider comfrey safe enough for external wounds, many do not recommend comfrey to be used on open wounds.</p>

         <p>Do not use pine needles during pregnancy as vitamin C in large amounts is connected to miscarriage.  Do not use inner bark longterm. Do not use pine resin internally except in minute amounts and under the guidance of a skilled herbalist.</p>
